At the time, Myka had kept audiences posted on the entire adoption process, from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crowdsourcing</a>, to facing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">international adoption regulations</a>, and eventually, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing her son home to America in 2017</a>. She had posted monetized videos focused on Huxley, and included him in ads. However, it seems as though he no longer lives with Myka, her three kids, and her husband, James.</p><p>Before apparently rehoming Huxley, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Myka Stauffer faced backlash for duct-taping her son's hands</a>.

According to Mirror, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huxley apparently sucked his thumb</a>, which is a relatively normal habit for many young children. But to break this habit, Myka apparently resorted to an unlikely deterrent: duct tape.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Mayo Clinic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thumb-sucking is generally a coping mechanism</a> for children. Although it's important to deter them from doing so, to prevent a dependency and possible dental damage, it's recommended to make them aware they're doing it, and to teach them to rely on other things for comfort instead, while not cutting them off from it completely. Duct-taping Huxley's hands was not only an abrupt and aggressive way to cut him off from thumb-sucking, but it most likely hurt his skin.&nbsp;</p><p>The duct tape on Huxley's hands was apparently visible in one of Myka's last videos before rehoming him, and obviously, it garnered tremendous backlash from people on Twitter. See what they had to say about it below.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi, this is Myka. Myka adopted an autistic son from China who she named Huxley.

Eventually, though, she and her husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made a video</a> about how they decided to put him back up for adoption. Apparently, several people recommended they do so, as they hadn't foreseen the severity of his disabilities.</p><p>“Once Huxley came home, there were a lot more special needs that we weren’t aware of... So over the past few years, Huxley has been in numerous therapies to try and help him... For us, it’s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals. A lot of their feedback [has been] really upsetting for us, because it’s not what we ever wanted to hear. We never wanted to be in this position, and we’ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible,” James said in the video.</p><p>There wasn’t a minute that [we] didn’t try our hardest. And I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that [with] his medical needs, he needed more... Do I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500 percent,” she said. "…The last couple of months have been the hardest thing I could’ve ever imagined,” Myka added, saying they waited to tell viewers to "protect Huxley."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Myka and James' decision to rehome their adopted son doesn't seem like an easy one, but needless to say, we're hoping he's found a more fit set of parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfosasrYysq5qtlpuys3nDrpqtZaSWvaY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmyka-stauffer-duct-tape.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-mole-season-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-mole-season-2.html>Has Netflix Renewed or Canceled 'The Mole' for Season 2?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brighton-fans-stabbed-ahead-of-europa-league-clash-with-roma.html>Brighton Fans Stabbed Ahead Of Europa League Clash With Roma</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brighton-fans-stabbed-ahead-of-europa-league-clash-with-roma.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
