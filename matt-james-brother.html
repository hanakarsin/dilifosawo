In the season premiere of The Bachelor, we were introduced to Matt and his mother, Patty James, when he had an emotional sit-down with her and talked a little about his childhood and how life was <a href=#>growing up in a biracial family</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt grew up with his mother, Patty, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his older brother, John</a>, in North Carolina. His father was "absent" from their lives after his parents split when he was little. On the season premiere, Matt did not talk about his brother, and since he's talked a lot about Patty, it left us all wondering who John is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Matt's older brother, John?</h2><p>John James is Matt's older brother who was also raised by his mother, Patty James, in North Carolina. His age is not known, but he appears to be in his early 30s. Matt is pretty quiet when it comes to his brother on The Bachelor, via social media, and in interviews. However, he did talk about his brother briefly earlier in January in an interview with Entertainment Tonight.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, he talks about how faith is important to him, but it's not crucial for his partner to share his beliefs. Matt says, "My views are my own and I would never force that on somebody, especially with those views being different within my family," he said. "My brother and I have completely different religious beliefs, and I don't love him any less. I would never want that to be something that kept me from being with somebody."&nbsp;</p><p>So, two things we know about John is that, when it comes to his religious beliefs, they couldn't be further away from Matt's, but John will always receive love from his younger brother no matter what. Now that's brotherly love!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: SoundCloud</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What does John James do for a living?</h2><p>John is a rap artist and, from his account on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a>, it appears that he's been rapping for at least the last six years under the name John the Scorpio. You can listen to his new track "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sometimes</a>" that was uploaded to the site at the end of 2020, along with some of his older work. He even has a video, "Gotta Do Betta," that he debuted back in August on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p><p>After watching the video and listening to the track, you will quickly be able to see the major differences between the brothers, but it's obvious that they're both talented.&nbsp;But, what else do we know about John James?&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, John does not post too much on his Instagram or Facebook accounts. What we do know from photos posted is that he's a fan of Nipsey Hussle, he's into horseback riding, and he enjoys riding dirtbikes. Also, if you watch his video on YouTube, you'll notice that he is a fan of former NFL player and activist Colin Kaepernick.&nbsp;</p><p>There don't seem to be any photos suggesting that he in a relationship, but he might be tight-lipped when it comes to his romantic life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Matt James Fan Page (@mattjamesfan)</a></p></figure><p>Although Matt doesn't post much about his brother, his fans know that there's a lot of love that he has for John, and they seem to enjoy spending time together. Back in July 2020, fans caught a glimpse of John on Matt's Instagram Stories during a long (and slightly competitive) bike ride. So even though Matt hasn't talked much about him on The Bachelor, it's evident that the brothers are close. Perhaps we'll see more of John later on in the season.</p><p>Watch The Bachelor on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq61wIyjmKado2Kvs7vToZyr</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-james-brother.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-call-her-daddy-podcast-over.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-call-her-daddy-podcast-over.html>Is 'Call Her Daddy' a Thing of the Past?
