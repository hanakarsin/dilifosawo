Hon. Blessing Agbebaku</strong> has described some reports about plans to impeach the Deputy Governor of the State, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Philip Shaibu</a></strong> as rumours from the pit of hell.</p><p>The Speaker revealed that when the rumours started making rounds, the state Governor, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Godwin Obaseki</a></strong> called him to ascertain the truth and he told the Governor the lawmakers were not planning anything of such.</p><p>Agbebaku who spoke on Friday when the 24 members of the Assembly visited Governor Obaseki at the Government House, in Benin City said he also called the Deputy Governor to inform him the lawmakers have no impeachment plans against him.</p><p>He, therefore, urged the people of the state to disregard any report claiming they want to impeach Shaibu or that the Governor has directed the legislators to impeach him.</p><p>He said, “We are here to clear the air on the insinuation of the impeachment of the Deputy Governor of Edo State. I want to let the people of Edo State know that there was nothing of such in the State House of Assembly.</p><p>“There was no time that the governor called me and instructed me that there must be an impeachment against the Deputy Governor. The rumour of impeachment is from the pit of hell. I want to let Edo people know today that till tomorrow, and the governor has not called to say the deputy governor should be impeached, next tomorrow is coming and I don’t think the governor will say that to us.”</p><p>The Speaker further noted, “When I approached the governor, he asked if there’s anything of such? He asked what the impeachment is for? I told him there is no such plan. Nothing of such is going on. On my own, I called the Deputy Governor to tell him that there is nothing like an impeachment plan by the Assembly and what he heard was rumour.”</p><p>Agbebaku continued, “Today, I want to let Edo people know that the story about the impeachment of the Deputy Governor is just mere rumour as the governor has no such plans today, tomorrow, and forever; the governor doesn’t have such plans.</p><p>“This will be our second courtesy call to you (Governor). We are here to remind you that what we came to tell you in our first courtesy call, we are standing by it. We are resolute to follow in your footsteps and ensure you finish well. It is our responsibility as members of our various constituencies to give you the backing to finish well and strong.</p><p>“I also want to thank you for your resilience and for the rumors making you address the press as we don’t need that now but what we need is to make Edo people happy. We are here to support you and ensure you finish strong.</p><p>“The 24 members of the EDHA are all here to let you know that we will join you to finish strong as Edo people must live a good life and you are already setting the pace.”</p><p>On his part, Governor Godwin Obaseki vowed that his administration won’t be distracted from the task of delivering the dividends of democracy to the people of Edo State.</p><p>He added that there is no crisis in Edo State and thanked the members of the State Assembly for their support.</p><p>In his words, “We have done so much in Edo. What the world should be hearing about us now should be the positive things going on in the State, not news about trouble or crisis. I want to thank the Speaker and members of the Assembly for this courtesy and solidarity visit. We have so much work to be done and I will try as much as possible not to allow any distraction.</p><p>“There is no crisis in Edo. No crisis in government. No crisis in EDHA and those who benefit from crisis, creating crisis, reporting crisis should not be given the opportunity here. What should be of concern to us today is the failure of federal roads in the State which have almost incapacitated the State as the people are unable to move. That should be a crucial concern to us as Edo people. Crisis situation is like a war situation where we can’t move within our State. We have extensive federal roads and they lack the capacity of maintaining it and we in Edo and in the Country are almost cut off.”</p><p>The governor added, “We must speak about this and our citizens must know this and the efforts we have put in and that we are trying our best to build our own internal roads to get out of this situation and grow the economy of our State.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BxZp6cn2LAsbHApJyrZZOhsqK%2B0maroZ1dlrazec6nZKiakaiyrLWMoqWsrKKqsLW1zaBkrKyRqbJurdKsnKaanK56tbuMoqSpnZGYtW6%2Fx5qgm61f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fedo-speaker-clears-the-air-on-obaseki-instructing-state-assembly-to-impeach-shaibu.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./odessa-adlon-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./odessa-adlon-html.html>Odessa A'zion - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1392947-best-superman-actor-all-clark-kents-throughout-years-ranked-html.html>Best Superman actor: All Clark Kents throughout the years ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1392947-best-superman-actor-all-clark-kents-throughout-years-ranked-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
