Out of respect and utmost reverence for our late Governor, we chose not to engage with those spreading this narrative.</p><p>“While we acknowledge that the political atmosphere in the state is intensifying, we want to unequivocally state that the late Governor did not anoint or express a desire for Aiyedatiwa to succeed him. On the contrary, the relationship between the late Governor and Governor Aiyedatiwa became strained and distant until his passing,” The PUNCH quoted Olatunde saying.</p><p>The statement reads further: “Despite attending to official matters and meeting people from Akure, the late Governor intentionally kept Aiyedatiwa, who was the deputy governor at the time, away from him in Ibadan.</p><p>“Our late Governor was deeply disappointed and regretful of certain behaviours and character traits displayed by Mr Aiyedatiwa during his health challenges, which ultimately led to his passing.</p><p>“We have also observed the circulation of a video recorded during the swearing-in ceremony of the late Governor and Mr Aiyedatiwa as Governor and deputy governor, respectively. Undoubtedly, our late Governor had high hopes for Mr. Aiyedatiwa. The late Akeredolu never concealed his intentions.</p><p>“One thing that discerning minds can clearly see is the turn of events in the latter half of last year. Trust was betrayed, confidence was shattered, and the true colours of desperation overshadowed the good intentions of our late Governor. What followed was a tale of disappointment and betrayal. Our late leader, to say the least, was heartbroken before his demise.</p><p>“We, therefore, caution Mr. Aiyedatiwa to cease these deceptive tactics and focus on his campaign. Akeredolu’s ardent followers, including members of his family, do not support Mr. Aiyedatiwa’s aspiration to clinch the ticket of the party.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BsZpqjlaeypbvLrmSdoZSjwW6xzZ2mq6uVYsawwYysq6ioXa68tr6MnZycnaCptrexjK2YnKyZmMBuuMCtnGafn6vAbq3InZxmmpyWwLW%2FjJqgsp2UlsGqw8Bo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fakeredolu-didnt-endorse-you-stop-your-deceptive-tactics-late-govs-aide-blasts-aiyedatiwa.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./annie-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./annie-html.html>Annie (2014) (Movie) - Cast, Ages, Trivia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-the-nfl-player-on-the-bachelorette.html>Who Is the NFL Player on Season 18 of 'The Bachelorette'?
