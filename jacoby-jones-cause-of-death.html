Jacoby died at his home in New Orleans, and the statement said, "The family, including his mother, Emily, and his son, Little Jacoby, are together and are asking for prayers, privacy, and support as they navigate through this difficult time."</p><p>It's unclear, then, exactly what happened to Jacoby, and there's been no reporting about his health leading up to his death.</p><p>The Baltimore Ravens remembered Jacoby in a statement released on July 14: "Jacoby had the unique ability to connect with everyone he encountered. His charisma, joy, and love created a one-of-a-kind presence that could light up any room or brighten any dark day."</p><p>Jacoby was a key part of the Ravens' 2012 Super Bowl run, including the "Mile High Miracle" when he caught the tying touchdown with just 31 seconds left against the Denver Broncos in the divisional round.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jacoby was remembered by his former coaches and teammates.</h2><p>Jacoby's final season in the NFL where he played was 2015, but he returned to the Ravens on a one-day contract in 2017 so that he could officially retire with the team after he was traded to the Steelers. Prior to coming to Baltimore, he also played five seasons with the Houston Texans.</p><p>Following the news of his death, many of his former coaches and teammates paid tribute to who he was both on and off the field.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My brother, you will truly be missed.
