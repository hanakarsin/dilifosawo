In the video, he shouts the n-word at his friends, saying, "take care of this p---y-a-s n----r."</p><p>The video immediately sparked outrage from his fans, who called Morgan out on his racist language.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I'm embarrassed and sorry," Morgan said in a statement at the time, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever."</p><p>He concluded his apology, saying, "I promise to do better."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Morgan pledged $500,000 to Black-led groups, but the promised sum never showed up.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, it appears as though Morgan hasn't made good on his July 2021 promise to donate $500,000 to black-led organizations after catching heat for his racist comment. The publication reached out to numerous organizations, including the Black Music Action Coalition, which Morgan mentioned by name, asking if they had received the funds. They answered that they were given only about $165,000.</p><p>BMAC organizers told the publication that they met with Morgan over the summer to help him understand "how deeply harmful, offensive, and unacceptable his use of the n-word was." However, they were upset that he barely condemned racist behavior as a whole.</p><p>Rolling Stone reportedly contacted "56 other state, regional, and national Black-led or Black-founded charities," and none confirmed that the singer had sent them any money either.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">That wasn't Morgan's first public apology either, his disregard of COVID-19 protocols landed him in hot water too.</h2><p>Morgan had also issued an apology in October 2020, when videos of him partying without a mask went viral before his SNL appearance.</p><p>"It's a tough video for me to make, but a necessary one [...] I'm in New York City, in a hotel room. I was getting ready for SNL this Saturday, and I got a call from the show letting me know that I will no longer be able to play and that that's because of COVID protocols," Morgan began his apology posted on Instagram.</p><p>"I'm not positive for COVID, but my actions this past weekend were pretty short-sighted, and they have obviously affected my long-term goals and dreams," Morgan added shortly after.</p><p>"I respect the show's decision because I know that I put them in jeopardy, and I take ownership [of] this. I'd like to apologize to SNL, to my fans, to my team [...] I let them down," Morgan said.</p><p>"And, on a more personal note, I have some growing up to do [...] I'm gonna take a step back from the spotlight for a little while," he explained.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I‚Äôve seen like 87 tiktoks similar to this one.

According to the video recordings, Morgan paid little attention to the regulations, partying at several locations instead.</p><p>Morgan's antics caused a great deal of stir on social media and beyond, with many taking a clear stance against the star for his failure to lead by example and putting himself and others at risk of contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19) instead.</p><p>"How do I get off of Morgan Wallen TikTok? Please, I‚Äôm begging you. I'm so tired of seeing videos of him kissing random girls and no one wearing masks and them being at bars packed shoulder to shoulder," wrote a person.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/@samyb875</span></figure><p>Some were equally angered by seeing the 27-year-old father of one out and about.</p><p>"It seems like that Morgan Wallen guy cares more about not being on SNL than being around his baby. Who has a baby and goes and kisses random girls at bars during a pandemic??" one wrote.</p><p>"I would like to publicly say I am much more concerned about the celebrities involved in pedophilia than how many girls Morgan Wallen kissed over the weekend. I suggest y'all do the same," argued another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyzs8CnZLCZnKGyr3nAqaalp5eu</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-apology.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./457938-patoranking-feat-wande-coal-my-woman-my-everything-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./457938-patoranking-feat-wande-coal-my-woman-my-everything-html.html>Patoranking Feat.
