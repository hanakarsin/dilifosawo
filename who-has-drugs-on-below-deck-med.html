So, <a href=#>who has drugs</a> on Below Deck Med? Keep reading.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who has drugs on 'Below Deck Med'?</h2><p>We knew this season off the coast of Spain would be an eventful one, but no one could have predicted the myriad of changes that have already transpired, only halfway into the season.</p><p>Between Lara being replaced by Bugsy, Peter being edited out of most footage, and Malia's boyfriend — who happens to be visiting — possibly taking over as yacht chef, our heads are legitimately spinning.&nbsp;</p><p>And that doesn't even begin to address one of the biggest plot twists about to occur this season: namely, the fall of Hannah Ferrier.</p><p>Early on, we had a hunch that <a href=#>Bugsy would be poised to take over as chief stew</a> of the yacht.</p><p>First, Bugsy is highly experienced as a chief stew, is better equipped to manage a team, and, to put it plainly, is better at her job in hospitality and is much more passionate about it than Hannah.</p><p>Second, Hannah has been phoning it in for seasons now, has hardly been doing even the bare minimum in her own position, is a terrible communicator with her team, has zero passion, or even investment,&nbsp;in her job, and is overdue — if we're being honest — for a replacement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>We also learned, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, that while Hannah was trying to play it off like she had quit the season, <a href=#>she was indeed fired</a>. "Hannah's crossed the line before," a source said, adding that she "eventually went too far" on The Wellington.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what finally pushed the chief stew over the edge this time? Self-administering drugs at sea, of course, which shouldn't come as a surprise to any viewer, given how much production has been zeroing in on every time she takes a pill.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Malia snitch on Hannah on 'Below Deck'?</h2><p>From what we are able to piece together through teasers, it seems like roommates Hannah and Malia might butt heads once Malia's significant other joins the crew. Things escalate when Malia, who already knows that Hannah has Valium in her bunk after having handed her some following last episode's panic attack, sends a picture of Hannah's pills to Captain Sandy, who has no choice but to fire her chief and promote Bugsy to new HBIC.</p><p>In a now-deleted post, Malia defended her decision to tell Captain Sandy about her roommate's stash of sedatives. "Let me clear the air- medical laws are different at sea and for good reason," she wrote on Instagram. "NO crew member is allowed to self-administer drugs, prescription or not, while on a vessel at sea."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It may not always be pretty but this is what yachting is all about!

Mental health issues are a big deal and that's why we have proper procedures in place. We all read & sign a drugs&nbsp; & alcohol policy before joining any boat- this is VERY CLEARLY laid out."</p><p>Malia also apologized for "calling Hannah's panic attack a 'freak out'," saying "that was unprofessional and poor wording," but emphasized that "yachting is my career." In other words, the bosun was looking out for the safety of the yacht, not trying to create "plot twists & TV drama."&nbsp;</p><p>Considering it's honestly not the first or even second time Hannah has crossed a line, we are ready for a new chief stew to take us through future rough waters.</p><p>Tune in to Below Deck Med, Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWweceaqmacoqq0tHnOp2SbnZykxG6wxJyiZqWVmQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-has-drugs-on-below-deck-med.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lagos-assembly-passes-victim-witnesses-protection-bill.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lagos-assembly-passes-victim-witnesses-protection-bill.html>Lagos Assembly Passes Victim, Witnesses Protection Bill</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./akpabio-buhari-deliberately-punished-the-senate-because-we-questioned-his-loan-requests-saraki.html>Akpabio: Buhari Deliberately Punished The Senate Because We Questioned His Loan Requests</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./akpabio-buhari-deliberately-punished-the-senate-because-we-questioned-his-loan-requests-saraki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
