Because this story contains both of these types of people.</p><p>After one woman notices that a neighbor has been throwing away their slightly used and seemingly valuable furniture, she decides to take the items and sell them online. The phrase ‚Äúone man‚Äôs trash is another's treasure,‚Äù definitely rings true here, but perhaps the word treasure should be switched to hustle. She was kind enough to document everything on <a href=#>TikTok</a> for our viewing pleasure.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Woman sells furniture on Facebook Marketplace that she got for free from a neighbor.</h2><p>A TikTok creator named Andrea (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@avocandreatoast</a>) took to the platform to show the world her latest plan to make a few extra bucks. She got items for free and plans to sell them on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>‚ÄúSomeone in my apartment doesn‚Äôt know what Facebook Marketplace is. I keep seeing free stuff lying around,‚Äù she says in her video, panning her phone to show all the furniture that was up for grabs in her building.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@avocandreatoast href=#>@avocandreatoast</a><p>another day, another dollar ü§£ü§ë I don't know what I'd do without facebook marketplace and I'm amazed that some people don't use it <a title=facebookmarketplacefinds href=#>#facebookmarketplacefinds</a> <a title=facebookmarketplacefurniture href=#>#facebookmarketplacefurniture</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=sideincomeideas href=#>#sideincomeideas</a> <a title=sellingfurniture href=#>#sellingfurniture</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - andrea" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - andrea</a></figure><p>Andrea explains that she took a bookcase for herself. But she also noticed a not-too-shabby desk and frame lying around and couldn't fathom why anyone would just give these items away.</p><p>‚ÄúI was just shocked at how pretty the frame was and why they weren‚Äôt even attempting to sell the desk on Facebook Marketplace. And then I got the genius idea to do it myself,‚Äù she said.</p><p>Andrea then showed us that she placed the desk on Facebook Marketplace ‚Äî and it had already sold.</p><p>‚ÄúI put it on for $20, got a million requests for it, and someone picked it up within two hours,‚Äù she reveals.</p><p>So to whoever is leaving your furniture out, please feel free to continue doing so,‚Äù Andrea says as she ends her video.</p><p>You definitely have to give Andrea props for her quick thinking. And while Andrea is technically selling someone else's items and pocketing the money for herself, her listing is still undoubtedly one of the more honest listings on Facebook Marketplace. After all, there are people selling seemingly <a href=#>stolen furniture from McDonald's on there.</a></p><p>There are also people trying to charge $500 for someone to come <a href=#>remove a bomb from their property</a>. If we could make that listing make sense, we would. But we can't.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@avocandreatoast</a></figure><p>In the comment section, users had all types of thoughts.</p><p>"Imagine you‚Äôre scrolling through FB marketplace and see the furniture you set outside for free," one person teased, to which Andrea admitted that she was actually a little nervous about that.</p><p>Another joked: "I would of made $500," insinuating that they would have jacked up the price. A third user claimed that they've actually been reselling other peoples' items and made over $2,000 within two years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@avocandreatoast</a></figure><p>However, the majority of folks seemed to have a somewhat negative opinion of Facebook Marketplace. And even though listing an item could mean that they'll have a few extra bucks lining their pockets, many claim they prefer to just donate their items.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@avocandreatoast</a></figure><p>"I donate everything because the people who buy from Facebook Marketplace in my area are super flaky and it's not worth it," wrote one user.</p><p>Others echoed similar complaints: "Facebook Marketplace sucks! I hate dealing with people asking stupid questions about the items. I would much rather just give it away to neighbors."</p><p>And as one user wrote: "Facebook Marketplace is for very patient people with lots of extra time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7Kqs8ebpqtlo5q5rbXNoGSfqpWaerTA1J%2BdZp6RmLKju86kZKaZoqCytbzLmpqe</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fneighbor-selling-free-stuff-facebook-marketplace.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-details-of-tinubus-meeting-wth-apc-governors-emerge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-details-of-tinubus-meeting-wth-apc-governors-emerge.html>Details Of Tinubu's Meeting Wth APC Governors Emerge</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-waffler69-tiktok.html>What Happened to Waffler69?
