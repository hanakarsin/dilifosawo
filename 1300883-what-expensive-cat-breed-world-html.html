To have this feline as your pet, you will have to part with up to $125,000. It is a rare feline. A fully grown <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ashera cat </a><a href=#>can</a> give birth to five kittens in a year, meaning this kind does not often reproduce.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to appearance, its patterned fur resembles that of a snow leopard, while its behaviour and temperament match that of Savannah felines.

The Savannah is highly trainable and friendly to other pets. Compared to other felines, it is energetic, agile, smart and curious.</p><p class=align-left>When it sees something strange, it tends to growl and produce a hissing sound. In appearance, it is tall and sleek with a golden coat colour.</p><h4>How much is a serval cat?</h4><p class=align-left>The<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Savannah felines</a> are categorized into F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 depending on the proportion of serval in the breed.

Surprisingly Khao Mannee's eyes are always in two different colours; as a result, people refer to them as the Diamond Eye Cat.</p><p class=align-left>The Diamond Eye Cat is expensive; to have this feline as your pet, you will part with $5,000 to $10,000.

The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Toyger cat </a>was developed in the 1980s by Jean Mill's daughter, Judy Sugden, who was passionate about cat breeding. They resemble a tiger in the sense that they have markings like that of the tiger. Unlike their Bengal cousins, they are completely domestic creatures and are always friendly and relaxed.</p><p class=align-left>This breed is very scarce; if you choose it as your pet, then be prepared to spend between $1,500 and $5,000 to get the best Toyger cat breed. Since Toyger was developed to create awareness of tiger preservation, most of their breeders channel some of the profit they get from their sales to tiger conservation.</p><h3>5.

Even though the mentioned feline breeds are the most expensive in the world, you can get them at affordable rates. Here are some factors that impact the price of a cat breed.</p><ul><li><strong>Age: </strong>Kittens are much more costly than adult cats. Moreover, their demand is high, and thus, the price is higher. Training a kitten than an adult puss is easier, and most people would want to see their pets grow under their care.</li><li><strong>Location:</strong> In urban areas, homeowners love keeping pets, which translates to high demand for tabbies, whereas the demand for cats is low in rural areas. The chances are high that you will purchase a particular feline breed at a lower price in rural areas than in urban areas.</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Would you like to buy a female or male puss? You should bear in mind that gender affects the pricing of the cat breed you want. Usually, a female puss is more expensive than the male one because it will reproduce in the future.</li><li><strong>Breeder:</strong> You should be careful about where you get your preferred cat breed. Licensed and recognized breeders who have a long-standing reputation for rearing healthy litter tend to set high prices for felines compared to pet stores that do not have any form of certification. It is advantageous to purchase from a licensed breeder because that is the only way to get a pure breed of cat.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/64a8332f57498f01.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 meanest celebrities who are a nightmare to interact with</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Cats are lovely pets to keep around you.
