Thank you," before sitting back down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Immediately, flight attendants followed proper protocol, directing him to wear a mask before ultimately deciding to turn the plane around back to Toronto. Allegedly, they were only 30 minutes from landing in Jamaica.</p><p>“Out of an abundance of caution, our crew followed all protocols for infectious disease on board, including sequestering an individual who made an unfounded claim regarding coronavirus,” a spokesperson for WestJet told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost Canada</a>.</p><p>According to James' apology video, though, he claims that the joke was "blown out of proportion."</p><p>James claimed that the video was meant to show his arrival in Jamaica and that his announcement was stated "jokingly."</p><p>He admitted that he "reached for an attention-grabbing word that would get the attention of the people around me in the very back seats of the plane," creating the "chaotic situation."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>The Coronavirus outbreak started in the city of Wuhan, which is not located in Hunan province. According to James, there's a Chinese restaurant in Toronto called Hunan Province, and the joke "was supposed to be interpreted as me not feeling well from eating Chinese food."</p><p>James was arrested once the flight touched down in Toronto and charged with mischief and breach of recognizance. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffPost Canada</a>, the charge carries a maximum 10-year sentence.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But James didn't seem that sorry about his prank.</h2><p>While James released an apology video (in which he's reading a pre-prepared statement directly from a notebook and mentions his music video he's working on), it's clear from other interviews he's done that he's not that apologetic for inconveniencing everyone on the flight.</p><p>"I'm an artist," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Global News</a>. "Any publicity for myself is good publicity."</p><p>He also admitted that he was "looking to get a viral video."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WestJet flight to Jamaica was turned around halfway there when a 29 year old man announced that he had the Corona Virus ...

"I was looking to create a video, yes, that would go viral."</p><p>James admitted that "in retrospect," he made a mistake.</p><p>"What I did was wrong," he said. "I ruined the flight for 200 and somewhat people. I ruined their flight."</p><p>James also told the outlet that he had previously made ridiculous announcements on planes with little problem, which was why he thought his joke wouldn't cause any problems.</p><p>In another attempt to cover for his mistake, James said in the last minute of his apology video "At no time did I say on the plane that I had Coronavirus." His apology video has over 33,000 views and 2,500 dislikes. At this time, only 85 people have "liked" the video.</p><p>And if this clearly-scripted, monotonous video apology isn't enough to prove that doesn't feel much remorse for his stunt, at the very end of the video, you can hear his cameraman say "Nice. That was good."</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
