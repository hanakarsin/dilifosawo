There are tons of different theories about what happens to us after we die, some more detailed than others.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also a slew of rituals and traditions across cultures that have evolved over time, but they all pretty much focus on one thing: celebrating and honoring the individual who passed away. Wakes, congregational prayers, funerals, you name it. Some people bury their dead and erect monuments in their memory; others put them on a raft and shoot a flaming arrow at it and watch it burn as it drifts along the water.</p><p>I'm not saying one is better than the other, but there's clearly a disparity of awesomeness between the two.</p><p>@SixthFormPoet's family went the monument and gravestone route when his father passed away. Although death isn't the funniest of set-ups for a story, it turns out his is simultaneously hilarious, gruesome, and very, very sweet.</p><p>SFP was really close to his dad, so he made it a habit of visiting his grave often. As it turns out, it was somewhat of a tradition in his family and one that they prided themselves on maintaining.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>They often expressed their love and remembrance for SFP's father in gorgeous flower bouquets. From the way SFP tells it, they kind of went a bit overboard, but it is beautiful for someone to keep another in their heart for so long, even after they pass. I'm getting strong <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coco vibes</a> just thinking about it.</p><p>While visiting his father's grave, however, SFP noticed the disparity between his father's grave and the dearly departed individual resting beside him. This neighbor never had any flowers or visitors.</p><p>So he did what any logical person would do: he bought flowers for that dead stranger.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>OK so it definitely wasn't the logical thing to do, but it was sweet. And it wasn't like SFP did it once or twice, he kept the tradition going. Every time he visited his dad, he'd get a little something for the man resting beside him. Since it wasn't something people normally do, and some would even argue it's kinda weird, he kept the whole thing a secret.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Over time, SFP;s interest in who this man was grew. What was driving him to bring a complete stranger flowers?</p><p>He had to know, so he looked the man up and, as it turns out, there was a pretty valid reason why no one ever visited his grave or brought him flowers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Yeah. Not too many people are going to be lining up for the kind of guy who not only manages to murder his wife and in-laws, but ruin Christmas for everybody, too.</p><p>SFP, trying to do something nice, inadvertently honored the memory of a murderer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Again, being the kind dude he is, he felt bad for the wife and parents who were killed by the guy he just celebrated for the past 30 months, and felt like he needed to make things right. An apology was in order.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>So he looked into where the woman and her parents were interred, got himself a bunch of flowers, and visited their graves to tell them he was sorry.</p><p>As he was muttering his regrets, it turns out a relative of the deceased was there to pay her respects, too. She wanted to know who he was and why he was there.</p><p>Calling that whole situation awkward would be the understatement of the year.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>He told her the entire story, and I can only imagine the panic-induced sweats he suffered as he relayed it.</p><p>As it turns out, she thought the whole thing was quite weird, of course, but definitely sweet. Awkward situation neutralized!&nbsp;</p><p>That is until he asked her out for a drink and made it even more awkward all over again!</p><p>But then she said yes and two years later, they're married.</p><p>Yes. Seriously.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Is this a tale of serendipity? Fate? Or maybe it's a tale of redemption, the ghost of a man who committed something so heinous and vile that he was trying to make amends by giving two people the gift of love? Or maybe it means that even in the saddest of circumstances, beauty can appear and that it just takes time and a kind heart to find it?</p><p>Or it could be a completely coincidental event that occurred because one dude was a strangely emotional weirdo with a penchant for putting flowers on random people's graves.</p><p>Personally, I like any of the former choices. A lot better to think about it that way.</p><p>As it turns out, he had some other stories that tied into this one.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>SFP told this wonderful story about how he and his kids decided to save up money for a trip to Disneyland. It involved a "good behavior reward" system.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Then, when they were up a sizable amount, they happened upon a cool homeless guy chilling in the park, with an amazing Kermit the Frog impersonation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>After learning what a homeless person was, his children felt bad — so bad that they were willing to forego their Disney vacation so this nice homeless man could have some cash.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>He obviously had to improvise and instead of giving a stranger thousands of dollars, helped put him up in a hostel instead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>And they even invited him over their house for Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p>Which leads us to our third story, that of Lucy and Tim.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>After Tim died suddnely, SFP was at a loss how to help Lucy and handed her his card, urging her to call if she needed anything. She didn't.</p><p>Until she did.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>She reached out to SFP (Matt) and informed him that she attempted to commit suicide, on Christmas Day. He trudged over in the cold rain to help her out and it turns out her suicide attempt wasn't a very good one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>After assuring her she was not going to die, someone knocked at the door, it was a paramedic.</p><p>She tried to aggrandize her suicide attempt, but it didn't work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>The paramedic caught on that she was lying and said that combining four Ibuprofren and two gins wasn't going to do anything to her.</p><p>So instead, Matt decided to bring Lucy over to his Christmas party where she met John, the homeless guy he also invited to said Christmas party. And the two of them really hit it off.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Hit it off so well, that they are now engaged to be married.</p><p>Aren't all three of these just wonderful?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7mww8SrqmarpKeur7PEq6pmn6KWw6Z50q2mq7E%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflowers-strangers-grave-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-purse-challenge-tiktok.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-purse-challenge-tiktok.html>Learn What the Latest Challenge Is</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1977-html.html>Celebrities Born in 1977 | Famous Birthdays</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1977-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
