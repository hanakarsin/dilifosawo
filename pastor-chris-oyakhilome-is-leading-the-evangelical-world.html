Missionaries spend their lives fundraising and volunteering their time and resources at local orphanages and schools, following the scriptures as they instruct all Christians to care for the orphaned, widowed and poor. The role has been switched for one African man who is making a substantial impact throughout the whole world, not only Africa.</span></p><p><span>President and Founder of international ministry LoveWorld Incorporated is Nigerian born pastor, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. Through online resources, local ministry centres around the world (Christ Embassy), international humanitarian efforts, and worldwide Christian conferences, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome have played a major part in bringing Africa for her first time to the forefront of the evangelical world.</span></p><h3><b>The First-Ever </b><b><i>World Evangelism Conference</i></b><b>&nbsp;</b></h3><p><i><span>“That which gains the attention of a leader will be solved.” Ugandan Proverb</span></i></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-218242 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Thousands-filled-the-SSE-Arena-Wembley-in-London-UK-for-the-first-ever-World-Evangelism-Conference-with-Pastor-Chris-Oyakhilome.jpg alt="Thousands filled the SSE Arena, Wembley in London UK for the first-ever World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome" width=601 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-218242 class=wp-caption-text>Thousands filled the SSE Arena, Wembley in London UK for the first-ever World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome</p><p><span>Thousands filled the SSE Arena, Wembley in London UK for the first-ever World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome</span></p><p><span>With such a large international following, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is known for hosting mega conferences in central parts of the world, creating an opportunity for the global Christian community to converge over one event. Pastor Chris Oyakhilome was joined most recently by fellow Evangelist, Pastor Benny Hinn, Founder and President of Benny Hinn Ministries, for an enormous event called the World Evangelism Conference 2019 (WEC). More than 5,000 ministers, pastors, and evangelists from all over the world filled the SSE Arena, Wembley in London for this 3-day event that took place over the weekend of August 9</span><span>th</span><span> – 11</span><span>th</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This was the first of its kind for the World Evangelism Conference, though Pastor Chris Oyakhilome and Pastor Benny Hinn have ministered alongside one another on several occasions before this. The World Evangelism Conference was meant for stirring the nations towards spiritual awakening, bringing the gospel of Jesus Christ to the places it has not yet been. Attendees of the conference were invited to take part in various sessions, workshops, and exhibitions in order to strengthen their evangelism skills for ultimate “soul-winning.”</span></p><h3><b>The Identity of Africa and Her Role in the Rest of the World</b></h3><p><i><span>“Listen, my dear brothers and sisters:&nbsp;Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world&nbsp;to be rich in faith&nbsp;and to inherit the kingdom&nbsp;he promised those who love him?” James 2:5</span></i></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-218243 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/A-total-of-177-countries-were-in-representation-at-the-World-Evangelism-Conference-with-Pastor-Chris-Oyakhilome.jpg alt="A total of 177 countries were in representation at the World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome" width=603 height=401 sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-218243 class=wp-caption-text>A total of 177 countries were in representation at the World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome</p><p><span>A total of 177 countries were in representation at the World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Could it be that Africa is gaining a new identity of pouring out into the world, rather than only receiving from the world? Perhaps this ground-breaking movement of evangelism coming forth out of Africa is the exact response to the years of prayer and service that Christians and humanitarian groups alike have endowed upon her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is setting the stage for the global spiritual awakening that is now stirring in Africa and soon to catch the attention of nations. At the World Evangelism Conference alone, there were over 170 countries in representation, all learning under Nigeria’s own Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. With an undoubting call of God on his life, He has built an empire fit for reaching the whole world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</span> <span>Together with several international ministers, as well as his own leadership within Christ Embassy, the WEC was a monumental moment marking the advancement of the gospel in the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>More than Africa, and more than only evangelical Christians; the entire world can be encouraged by this conference and what it represents. While Africa has managed to keep the world’s attention, it is not often in the beautiful stage lighting and outstanding musical performances such as those featured at the WEC. However, things are changing for Africa, and anointed leaders like Pastor Chris Oyakhilome are in the position of spearheading this global change.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>The World Evangelism Conference with Pastor Chris Marks the Future of the International Church</b></h3><p><i><span>“I have ordained him [Pastor Chris Oyakhilome] to bring a spirit of unity to the ministry that I have raised up in these last days!

Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, Pastor Benny Hinn and American evangelist Dr. Morris Cerullo united for one weekend of enriching teaching and transformative training.
