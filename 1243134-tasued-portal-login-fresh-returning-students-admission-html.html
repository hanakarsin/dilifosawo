One of the most used is the student and staff online portals. And Tai Solarin University has one of the best. So, how does one use the <a href=#>TASUED</a> student portal?</p><h2>TASUED's background</h2><p class=align-left>The Tai Solarin University of Education is the first and the only educational establishment of its kind in Nigeria. It engages modern technologies and services to provide a high quality of learning and teaching.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/593fd329b3248eee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“It’s a passion”: Meet Nigerian university professor who works as welder</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The university was proclaimed by the Ogun State Government on January 29, 2005, and approved by the National Commission (NUC) on November 28, 2005. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">university’s vision</a> is representative of what it offers:</p>To be the preferred education university which will excel in preparing educators who will be leaders in all spheres of the discipline.<h2>Motivations for digitising TASUED operations</h2><p class=align-left>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ademola Adenubi</a>, a director at TASUED and the founder/CEO of EduTAMS, insights were offered regarding the motivations that led the university to embark on the digitisation of its operations. Dr. Adenubi said:</p>The university needed to relook into a strategy and see if we could be self-sustainable. The excellent theme was critical, so the vice chancellor then, together with the (former) dean of the college of science and technology, Professor Abayomi Arigbabu, was passionate that we needed to digitise.We needed to do away with these issues of students having to struggle to have access to their academic results, to pay school fees, and even to get admission into the university. So, these were daunting challenges at that time, and we needed to build a solution to save the university from all of them.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f62efa61f3b7fa7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Enough is enough”: NIPOST sets deadline for crackdown on unregistered courier companies</span></p></a>Along the way, there was also a workshop that was called by the Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) in Abeokuta, inviting all the tertiary education institutions in Ogun State. The whole idea of the workshop was that institutions have to research how education can best be run with technology. We took that idea in and challenged ourselves to build a solution that can solve our problems, and by doing so, we can extend the solution to other institutions for some kind of relationship. We also desired to build a solution that would be globally competitive and could also emanate from TASUED. We started with that idea, and today we have built <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">EduTAMS</a> as a school management solution.<p class=align-left>Dr. Adenubi further said that TASUED's major decision to digitise its operations aimed at achieving the following objectives:</p><li>Facilitating immediate access to academic records, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of both academic and non-teaching staff.</li><li>Instilling discipline in the academic process.</li><li>Developing a robust web portal system to prevent leaks and ensure that all revenue is directed into the university's coffers.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d571a6f3cc897f34.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Go back home": Nigerian students, others reportedly deregistered by UK universities amid new law</span></p></a><h2>TASUED portal</h2><p class=align-left>Do you want to know how to log in to TASUED portal?

These challenges included:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ca116faa6ad2d3d1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Don’t miss out”: Lagos Govt releases application link for free tech skills training, job offer</span></p></a><li>Navigating the transition of staff from traditional manual processes to a digitised framework, particularly within the administration and academic departments.</li><li>Coping with the initial lack of funding during the early stages of developing the technology systems.</li><li>Addressing the perceptions and acceptance of local technology.</li><li>Managing talent effectively throughout the digital onboarding process.</li><p class=align-left>With the help of the Tai Solarin University of Education online platform, you can:</p><ul><li>Create your private account and access it any time you wish.

He explained that:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6df6c10d9580d31c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Boost for electricity as new firm set to begin 1GW Solar PV manufacturing plant in Nigeria</span></p></a>Now, our system has been enhanced since the last two sessions so that our students can make requests for their transcript online and do not need to come to campus before they can have access to their transcript. For example, just go to the university <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">e-request platform</a> and make your request, which will be received at the exams and records office, and they will check the records immediately. The next day, your transcript is almost ready for dispatch.Today in TASUED, every one of our processes, from the point of admission to the point of graduation, is completely digitised. For example, Student Affairs has access to the platform to do clearance, exams and records to process transcripts and results, and departments have access to be able to upload scores, approve courses, and allocate courses to lecturers. In summary, the adaptation of our technology is optimising productivity in terms of our staff, enhancing our revenue, giving us access to real-time data to support management decision-making processes, and also helping our students to have their records in real-time. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c7bd4f319d6f681.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian billionaire's company hands over N336bn bridge to FG after completion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Education is a powerful tool in the hands of a person who is passionate about discoveries and learning.
