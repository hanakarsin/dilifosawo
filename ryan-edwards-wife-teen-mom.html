At the time, Ryan had an active warrant for harassment, with his wife listed as the victim.</p><p>The reality TV personality’s arrest came one day after he allegedly posted revealing photos of Mackenzie on Instagram and accused her of infidelity.</p><p>An order of protection and a divorce filing later, Ryan was arrested again in March.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, the Teen Mom star took the comment section of a photo of him and his wife to air his grievances. “Take wife down off this I’m not proud of being married to someone that stays out in bars and goes home with others [sic] guys… tomorrow can’t get here fast enough!”</p><p>Several weeks after the accusation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he allegedly posted a revealing photo</a> of his wife’s chest and wrote, “If you guys have never seen a spineless slut this is one.” As a result, Mackenzie reported her husband to the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office, and they ordered him to vacate his residence immediately. The following day, Ryan contacted his wife’s father, Bob Standifer, and Mackenzie alerted the authorities.</p><p>“During the course of looking into the issue of breaking the Order of Protection, HCSO deputies learned that Ryan had an active warrant for Harassment which was taken out by the Chattanooga Police Department,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the arrest report read</a>. “Mackenzie was listed as the victim in that incident. That warrant was taken out on February 8, 2023.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan and Mackenzie have since split after six years of marriage.</h2><p>On Feb. 27, Mackenzie filed for divorce from Ryan after six years of marriage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> reported. Mackenzie was granted temporary custody of their two children, Jagger and Stella.</p><p>Just two days later on March 1, Ryan was arrested for stalking and violation of an order of protection, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>Ryan and his now-wife had previously said, “I do,” twice. Before the Teen Mom OG star checked into rehab in May 2017, he and Mackenzie secretly eloped. However, it was revealed that Ryan was high on drugs during the ceremony and drove himself and Mackenzie while under the influence. After the taping of their first wedding, Ryan decided to check himself into rehab.</p><p>“A little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Teen Mom alum said in a statement</a>. “Without the support of my wife and parents I would not have been able to do this. Thank you all for your well wishes.”</p><p>Then in 2018, the couple had a do-over. In Chattanooga, Tenn., Ryan and Mackenzie held a second wedding to compensate for their less-than-ideal first.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Ryan Edwards’ wife, Mackenzie, do for work?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mackenzie Edwards (@mackedwards95)</a></p></figure><p><a href=#>In 2021, the married couple got fired from Teen Mom OG</a> amid their feud with Ryan’s ex-partner <a href=#>Maci Bookout</a>.
