The matriarch and her kids continued to share their lives with the world until 2017. From there, Kate made appearances on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> and <a href=#>Celebrity Apprentice</a>. In 2019, she headlined a new series, Kate Plus Date, which ran for one season.

Also, the source told the outlet: “Kate hasn’t had a job other than reality TV for 17 years.

Hannah and Collin Gosselin live with their father, Jon Gosselin. But in 2018, Jon was awarded sole custody of their son Collin Gosselin, then 14, after he returned from a program for children with special needs that Kate had sent him to at Fairmount Behavioral Health Institute. Their daughter Hannah also decided she wanted to live with her father. Jon is still believed to be estranged from his other six children.</p><p>In 2016, Kate revealed that she had sent Collin to a residential program for kids with special needs, telling <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, that the program was "helping him learn the skills he needs to be the best him he can be." At the time, she did not reveal any specific diagnosis.</p><p>Collin and Jon were not too thrilled with Kate for sending him away.</p><p>"Kate institutionalized him without a diagnosis and then created a diagnosis,” Jon claimed in 2019 while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearing on the Dr. Oz show</a>. "He did not need to be in an institution. Just because he was a difficult child did not mean he needed to be sent away against my will, against my rights. I did not know where he went. It took me two and a half years to find him. It took me another year to get him out."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@viceontv href=#>@viceontv</a><p>We spoke to Collin Gosselin about his experience growing up on reality TV & his estranged mother. <a title=collingosselin href=#>#collingosselin</a> <a title=jonandkateplus8 href=#>#jonandkateplus8</a> <a title=jonandkate href=#>#jonandkate</a> <a title=realitytv href=#>#realitytv</a> <a title=vice href=#>#vice</a> <a title=vicetv href=#>#vicetv</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - VICE TV" href=#>♬ original sound - VICE TV</a></figure><p>In July 2023, Collin appeared on VICE TV’s series "Dark Side of the 2000s," where he spoke about his time being institutionalized. “Being in an institution really took a toll on me mentally,” Colin said. “It was a really dark place. You know, all I had was myself. I didn’t have anybody else. You know, I had no support system. I was confused. I was lost."</p><p>Following Collin's claims, Kate issued a statement on Instagram refuting his claims and noting that Collin had "multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years."</p><p>She explained that he was placed in an institution "for the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters, and for his own well-being." Despite not seeing him in years, Kate wrote, "unfortunately, I believe Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kate Gosselin (@kateplusmy8)</a></p></figure><p>Following Kate's statements, Jon's ex-girlfriend Colleen Conrad, who had spent a lot of time with Collin, defended him.</p><p>"I recently learned of derogatory statements made about Collin Gosselin and felt compelled to defend him. These statements were made by family members who have been estranged from his life since he was 12. Collin is not only someone I love dearly but has also been a significant figure in my family’s life. He is currently at boot camp for the Marines and he’s unable to defend himself," she wrote in an Instagram post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Colleen Lynne (@colleen.conrad122)</a></p></figure><p>She further claimed that Collin "was never violent and is far from being considered dangerous." She also said that he was "there for me when I need him, even bringing me white roses every time he visits."</p><p>Colleen further added: "He sought private psychiatric evaluations as an adult that disproved all the previous diagnoses. It was his determination that led him to the Marines, where he’s now fulfilling his dream. He wouldn’t be there if he hadn’t proved those diagnoses wrong." Collin is still believed to be in the Marines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlm5bBpnnGqKqsnZyeu266zrA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-kate-gosselin-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1191964-eating-dream-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1191964-eating-dream-html.html>Eating in the dream - what does it mean?
