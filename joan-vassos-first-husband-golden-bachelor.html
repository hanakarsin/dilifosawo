Everyone admired her for putting family first, and ever since, fans have been rooting for Joan to find her own happily ever after.</p><p>Luckily, their wish is coming true because, on May 14, 2024, ABC announced that Joan will be the leading lady for the inaugural season of <a href=#>The Golden Bachelorette</a>! Now, before we dive into her search for a second chance at love, let's explore her first marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: John Fleenor/ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who was 'The Golden Bachelorette' star Joan Vassos' first husband?</h2><p>Years before applying for the reality dating show, Joan was married to her husband, John Nicholas Vassos, for 32 years. However, on Jan. 18, 2021, he sadly passed away after a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. John was 59 years old.</p><p>According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obituary</a>, John was born on Nov. 27, 1961, in Washington, D.C. He was a graduate of Salisbury University and owned and operated BCE Corporation and CapX Solutions. He was a member of St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and he had a special connection with St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Bethesda, Md.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joan Vassos (@joan_vassos)</a></p></figure><p>"John embraced life with vigor and never did anything halfway. If you were his friend, he loved you forever and would do anything for you. He was known for his epic generosity, and it is impossible to count the number of people and organizations he supported," the obituary said.</p><p>The obituary further mentioned, "The beach was his most favorite place in the world, and sitting on his dock at sunset with family and friends was his heaven on earth. ... He loved watching sports, and there was always a game on the TV. He would even watch cornhole if there wasn't anything else on!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Joan said John always made her "feel safe."</h2><p>On the third anniversary of John's death, which fell on Jan. 18, 2024, Joan took to Instagram and shared a photo of the couple with their four kids. She wrote, "Some days it seems like it just happened, and I can't catch my breath, still feeling the shock of it. Other days it feels like he's been gone a lifetime, those days are worse because I'm afraid the memories are fading. I think that's what scares me the most."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><p>"He was the husband that always made me feel safe and cherished," she continued. "He was the parent that was always the fun one because that's all he knew how to do... lucky kids because fun in his book was generally epic. I could go on for hours."</p><p>Joan concluded, "Honestly, I think that's how he would want to be remembered... by not forgetting him. Please keep telling the stories, don't worry, they don't make me sad... let's be honest, most of them are funny! As the Greeks say, 'May his memory be eternal.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yiuoyvmKyrn6h6p7XRrKtmoKWor6K6w2aeqKSUmrtursCcn56kn6c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoan-vassos-first-husband-golden-bachelor.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cbn-may-hike-interest-rate-again-soon-reports.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cbn-may-hike-interest-rate-again-soon-reports.html>CBN May Hike Interest Rate Again Soon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./danielle-cabral-rhonj-brother.html>Who Is 'RHONJ' Star Danielle Cabral's Brother?
