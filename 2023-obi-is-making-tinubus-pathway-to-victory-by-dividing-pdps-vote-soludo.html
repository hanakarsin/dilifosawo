Afterwards, we would start complaining that we don’t get “what we deserve” or cry of marginalisation.</p><p>“During the 2019 presidential election, the five South East States were united for PDP but contributed merely 1.6 million votes to PDP which was about the votes that Kano state gave to Buhari.</p><p>“The emotions might run to the heavens but politics-power is about cold calculations, organization and building alliances for power. In a democracy, it is a game of numbers.</p><p>“So far, I don’t see any of these— and 2023 might again be a wasted opportunity for Ndigbo! What is our Plan B when Peter Obi loses in February 2023? Some people prefer that we should play the Ostrich while Peter Obi toys with the collective destiny of over 60 million Igbos.</p><p>“Yes, you pray that he wins, but what if he fails as he is certain to? The Bible says that my people perish for lack of knowledge. As the saying goes, only those who Plan can control the future. Ndigbo, wake up and smell the coffee.</p><p>“Of course, Peter Obi will get some votes and may probably win in Anambra state— as “homeboy”. But Anambra is not Nigeria. If he likes, I can even campaign for him but that won’t change much.</p><p>“From internal state-by-state polling available to me, he was on course to get 25% in 5 states as of August this year. The latest polling shows that it is down to four states and declining.</p><p>“Not even in Lagos State (supposed headquarters of urban youths) where the Labour Party could not find candidates to contest for House of Reps or Senate. The polls also show that he is taking votes away mostly from PDP.</p><p>“Indeed, if I were Asiwaju Tinubu, I would even give Peter Obi money as someone heading one of the departments of his campaign because Obi is making Tinubu’s pathway to victory much easier by indirectly pulling down PDP. It is what it is!’</p><p>“I used to think that for decent people, certain conducts are off-limits and that in Anambra, politics is not warfare.</p><p>“Ideally, I should just have laughed off the infantile exuberances as many friends advised (I am used to this, having been in the ‘Arena’ for a while). I always re-read the quote “The Man in the Arena…” by President Theodore Roosevelt (1910) to remind myself of the burden of public office.</p><p>“Several well-meaning Nigerians and Ndigbo called to advise that I should just ignore them. A respected Igbo elder-statesman who called, advised that I should just ignore what he described as “Peter Obi and his social media mob”. According to him, “everyone knows that he is going nowhere but they are looking for who to blame.</p><p>“Everyone knows that I don’t follow the winds nor succumb to bullies, nor shy away from a good fight especially when weighty matters of principles and the future of the people are involved. One lesson I learnt from my former boss and mentor, President Obasanjo, is never to be on the fence.</p><p>“I learnt that one must always take a stand: for better or for worse. I do so with every sense of humility, and leave history to judge. Most people have commended me for “tactfully avoiding being drawn into the Peter Obi issue” until now.</p><p>“Since I am now being forced into the Arena on this matter, I have a duty and a right of reply, if only for the records, and to also give the social media mob something substantive to rant upon and rain their abuses for weeks.</p><p>“In this preliminary response, there are some things I will refrain from saying here because, in the end, February/March 2023 will come and go, and life will continue.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BtZmtoYmh6sK7IZqCsZZ2WuKq6xmaroqall8K0ec%2Baq6Gvka56tbuMr6CcrJ%2Bnxm6u2Gaboq6Zmbavs4ypm6mrXau8tbGMrKalrZSkfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2023-obi-is-making-tinubus-pathway-to-victory-by-dividing-pdps-vote-soludo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./face-of-school-teacher-who-abducted-and-brutally-murdered-missing-5-year-old-girl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./face-of-school-teacher-who-abducted-and-brutally-murdered-missing-5-year-old-girl.html>Face Of School Teacher Who Abducted And Brutally Murdered Missing 5-Year-Old Girl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taiwo-awoniyi-eyes-4th-afcon-trophy-for-nigeria.html>Taiwo Awoniyi Eyes 4th AFCON Trophy For Nigeria</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taiwo-awoniyi-eyes-4th-afcon-trophy-for-nigeria.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
